# Travonex Project Updates Summary

This document provides a summary of the recent changes made to the Travonex application. It is intended for developers, especially backend developers, to understand the current state of the frontend application and its interactions with backend services like Firebase.

## Key Feature Updates

### 1. Centralized User Actions on the Blog Page (`/blog`)

- **Login/Signup Flow:** The primary user login and signup buttons have been removed from the main site header and home page.
- **New Call-to-Action Hub:** All user-centric actions are now located in the hero section of the `/blog` page. This includes:
    - A prominent "Login / Sign Up" button for unauthenticated users.
    - A user avatar and name for authenticated users.
    - An "Add Your Story" button.
- **Backend Interaction:**
    - The buttons rely on Firebase Authentication (`useAuth` hook).
    - The "Add Your Story" button checks the user's auth state. If logged in, it redirects to `/dashboard/submit`. If not, it redirects to `/login`.

### 2. Interactive Blog Post Features (`/blog/[slug]`)

- **New "Interactive Section":** A new component (`src/components/blog/interactive-section.tsx`) has been added to individual blog post pages.
- **Functionality:** This section allows logged-in users to:
    - **Add Comments:** Post short comments on an article.
    - **Share Follow-up Stories:** Post longer-form stories related to the article.
    - **Image Uploads:** Attach an image to both comments and stories.
- **UI/UX:**
    - The sections for "Comments" and "Follow-up Stories" are within a collapsible accordion to keep the UI clean.
    - Submissions are handled through modal dialogs for a focused user experience.
- **Backend Interaction:**
    - This section heavily depends on a backend (like Firestore) to store and retrieve comments, stories, and image URLs associated with a specific `articleId`. The current implementation uses mock data as a placeholder.

## Bug Fixes

### 1. Firebase Authentication Errors

- **`auth/api-key-not-valid`:** This was resolved by generating and populating the `.env` file with the correct Firebase project configuration keys.
- **`auth/configuration-not-found`:** This error occurs when sign-in providers (Email/Password, Google) are not enabled in the Firebase Console. This is a **manual step** that must be performed by the project owner. The code is correct, but the Firebase project itself needs to be configured.

### 2. Next.js/React Rendering Errors

- **`searchParams` Access Error:** Fixed an error on the `/blog` page by switching from direct `searchParams` property access to using the `useSearchParams` hook, which is the correct method for client components in Next.js.
- **`router.push` in Render:** Resolved a React warning ("Cannot update a component while rendering a different component") on the login and signup pages. The redirection logic (`router.push`) was moved into a `useEffect` hook to ensure it runs only after the component has rendered, which is the correct pattern for handling side effects.

## Summary for Backend Developers

- The frontend is fully integrated with **Firebase Authentication**.
- The new interactive features on the blog post page will require **Firestore collections** to store comments and stories. Each document should be linked to an `articleId`.
- Image uploads will require **Firebase Storage** to be set up. The frontend will need a mechanism to upload the file and get back a public URL to store in the Firestore document for the comment or story.
- All user-specific data (like checking roles) is handled via the `useAuth` hook, which in turn reads from a `users` collection in Firestore.
